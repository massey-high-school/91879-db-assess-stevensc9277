Affogato (Dessert, Tascas)
This dish is vegetarian.
For the uninitiated affogato is a scoop of vanilla ice cream ‘drowned’ in a shot of hot espresso.  This is combines two of my favourite things, ice cream and coffee. Provided the coffee (and ice cream) are of high quality this is the ultimate simple dessert.  Tascas does this quite well and has earned a rating of four stars.  This gets a rating of 4/5.

French Toast (Breakfast, Home)
This dish is vegetarian.
The trick to this one is to use homemade raison bread (instead of shop-bought white / brown bread) and be generous with the amount of syrup / cinnamon and sugar added on the top.  Provided the egg is properly cooked this is the ultimate in decadent breakfasts. It is a once a year treat that is totally worth every calorie.  This gets a rating of 5/5.

Blind Scouse (Lunch, Home)
This dish is vegetarian.
This is one of those ‘make it in advance’, freeze it and then eat it jobs.  It’s a stew made of potato, carrots, lentils and spices. The good thing about it is that it quick to reheat, healthy and filling.  Having said that, it is not something you’d want to eat everyday, as it can be a bit boring.  This gets a rating of 3/5.
